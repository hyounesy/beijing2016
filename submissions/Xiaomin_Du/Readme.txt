In this homework, I tried several ways to present the data, including the scatter plot, bar plot, parallel coordinates, pie chart and the table view. The methods I used may not be difficult, I think. But from these pictures, I still could see the different categories or other properties of the movies data and the various proportions of them, which is interesting. And by scatterplot and bar plot I could notice a certain kind of relationship between the x and y axis,too.

In addition, the parallel coordinates also show this multi-dimensional data in a novel way. But it may still need me to learn more about VisRSeq or do some data preprocessing before using it, because from the results I could see that there are a lot of lines over there when using the parallel coordinates, which makes me feel a little hard to analyze the attributes.
